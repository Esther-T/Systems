**CUDAs.cu** is a CUDA program that parallelizes a computationally intensive loop containing conditional logic, illustrating how traditional serial code can be transformed into an efficient data-parallel GPU kernel using NVIDIA's CUDA programming model. This file showcases core CUDA concepts such as kernel execution, thread indexing, and conditional branching on the GPU.

**Parallel.c** is a parallel program that utilizes implements a parallel merge sort algorithm using multiple threads to independently sort sub-arrays. By decomposing the problem and assigning each partition to a separate thread, the program demonstrates effective task-level parallelism on multi-core CPUs. This implementation highlights concurrency control, performance scalability, and efficient use of shared-memory architectures.

**Strip_mining.s** is a RISC-V assembly program that implements the strip mining optimization technique, commonly used in high-performance and vectorized computing. The program processes large data sets in smaller, cache-friendly blocks to improve instruction-level efficiency and memory access patterns. This low-level implementation provides insight into how compilers and hardware-aware programmers optimize loops for modern processor architectures.
